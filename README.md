# Eric Partlo
Currently my focus is on learning new languages such as MATLAB, python, and R. In addition to learning new languages I also work on better software design and engineering principles. Such as geospatial techniques, RADAR theory, aerospace engineering, astrodynamics/orbit mechanics, rocket systems, cloud computing, linear algebra, information/number theory, digital signal processing.

#Github Projects
My Github has several projects focused on learning software development. Many of the examples are from books and online sources. All of these retain the original copyright protocol and are used only for educational purpose.  All of the solutions follow their respective copyright policy defined in each of the Github readme files.
